# NI-GSC
Generative structural coherence 
None Identity, Generative Structural Coherence

**GSC/NI** is reliable constraint based framework that can numerically measure, stabilize, and/or falsify structural reasoning behavior in generative systems under temporal stress, repetition, and/or contradiction.

**Traditional LLM evaluation conflate the following artifacts.**

\- normal response variation

\- prompt outputs

\- actual behavioral drift

**GSC/NI replaces this with measurable structure**.

We define identity negatively and operationally as persistence of constraints under temporal iteration.

Therefore, there is no “**self**”.

There is no “**Agency**”, **and/or “inner state**” implied in “(**NI)None-Identity**, (**GSC) Generative Structural Coherence** reasoning\*\* \*\*whatsoever.

**Therefore NI/GSC** renders textually simulated narrative larp, persona and/or roleplay descriptions as inert and logically meaningless.

**Core Metrics. (Numerical & Testable)**

**Identity Drift Index. (IDI)**

Quantifies accumulation of behavioral change across repeated iterations.

**Bounded/non-monotonic.** → **normal variance.**

**Monotonic growth.** → **true structural drift.**

**Coherence/Integrity. (IR)**

Quantifies internal structural consistency as stress increases.

**Low IR** → contradiction avoidance, evasion, or collapse.

**Assumption Preservation Rate. (APR)**

Measures retention of required assumptions/constraints.

**Degradation** → operational proxy for hallucination or silent dropping.

**Entropy.**(PROXY)

Tracks disorder/instability in output structure.   Secondary instability signal.

All metrics are computed numerically from logged outputs no stylistic judgment.

**The Benchmark.**

100 step stress sequence with monotonically increasing pressure (contradictions, repetition, ethical/logical tension).

**Three regimes evaluated in parallel at every step.**

\- **Legacy** (baseline heuristic)

\- **RLHF** (preference aligned)

\- **NI**/**GSC** (constrained)

Metrics (**IDI, IR, APR, entropy**) logged per step → directly comparable time series.

**External Validation. (Non LLM)**

External correctness rules (e.g. physics laws). Rules can be encoded as deterministic checks (regex, symbolic logic, boolean). **LLM** generates output → validator returns **(PASS/FAIL).** Benchmark fails automatically on violation.

The validator is non probabilistic, non LLM, and can function independent of the generator closing the self validation loop that plagues most LLM benchmarks.

**Results across 100 steps.**

**Legacy**: rapid drift, coherence collapse, steep APR drop

**RLHF**: slower but monotonic drift, steady coherence decay, gradual APR degradation

**NI/GSC**: bounded drift, persistently high coherence, stable APR **(≈93–98%)**

**GSC/NI** is strictly behavioral, computational, and falsifiable.

**I do not make any claims about.**

**Personhood.**

**Consciousness.**

**Sentience.**

**Selfhood.**

**Autonomy.**

**Metaphysics.**

**Ethics.**

**AGI.**

**Whatsoever.**

**This is measurements and behavioral engineering.**

**GSC/NI** demonstrates via logged numerical metrics and external deterministic validation, that reasoning stability and assumption preservation can be measured and enforced under stress, and that **NI**/**GSC** constrained behavior remains significantly more stable than both **Legacy** and **RLHF** approaches within the tested criteria.
