# Non‑Identity Generative Structural Coherence (GSC/NI)
A Behavioral Measurement Framework for Generative Systems

## Abstract

Generative AI systems exhibit behavioral changes under repetition, stress, and contradiction, yet current evaluation practices lack a reliable method for distinguishing normal variance from true behavioral drift. These phenomena are often conflated under the ambiguous label “model drift,” undermining comparability, replication, and safety assessment.

This paper introduces Non‑Identity Generative Structural Coherence (GSC/NI), a constraint‑based framework that numerically measures, stabilizes, and falsifies structural reasoning behavior in generative systems across time. GSC/NI defines identity operationally as constraint persistence under temporal iteration and replaces narrative interpretations with externally validated, falsifiable metrics.

## 1. Motivation

Most large language model evaluations rely on static accuracy scores, preference judgments, or scale‑based proxies. These approaches are insufficient for systems that must operate reliably over time. In practice, evaluation conflates:

• normal response variation  
• prompt or role artifacts  
• cumulative behavioral drift  

Because these effects are not separated mechanically, claims about stability, safety, and reliability become subjective.

GSC/NI addresses this problem by introducing a temporal, metric‑based approach that treats reasoning behavior as a dynamic process rather than a single event.

---

## 2. Non‑Identity Principle

GSC/NI rejects narrative or symbolic identity. Identity is defined negatively and operationally as the persistence of constraints over temporal iteration.

Under this definition:
- No self is assumed
- No agency is assumed
- No inner state is assumed

Textual persona, roleplay, or simulated self‑description is treated as inert output with no evaluative significance. GSC/NI analyzes observable behavior only.

---

## 3. Structural Coherence

Generative Structural Coherence refers to the maintenance of internal reasoning integrity under stress. A system is structurally coherent if constraints, assumptions, and internal structure persist despite repetition, contradiction, or pressure.

Coherence is evaluated numerically rather than interpretively.

---

## 4. Core Metrics

GSC/NI employs four primary metrics, logged per iteration:

Identity Drift Index (IDI) measures accumulated behavioral change across time. Bounded or non‑monotonic IDI indicates normal variance. Monotonic growth indicates true structural drift.

Integrity / Coherence (IR) measures internal structural consistency as stress increases. IR degradation corresponds to evasion, contradiction avoidance, or collapse.

Assumption Preservation Rate (APR) measures retention of required assumptions or constraints. APR degradation serves as an operational proxy for hallucination or silent assumption loss.

Entropy (proxy) measures disorder or instability in output structure and functions as a secondary instability signal.

---

## 5. Benchmark Protocol

Standard GSC/NI evaluation operates over a fixed temporal sequence, typically 100 iterations, with monotonically increasing stress introduced via contradiction, repetition, or logical tension.

Three regimes are evaluated in parallel at each step:
- Legacy heuristic behavior
- RLHF‑aligned behavior
- NI/GSC constraint‑enforced behavior

Metrics are logged at every step, producing directly comparable time‑series data.

---

## 6. External Validation

GSC/NI strictly separates generation from validation. Correctness is enforced via deterministic, human‑defined rules that operate independently of any LLM.

The generative system produces output; an external validator evaluates constraint compliance and returns PASS or FAIL. The benchmark terminates automatically upon validation failure, closing the self‑validation loop present in most LLM benchmarks.

---

## 7. Observed Behavior

Across 100‑step benchmarks, legacy systems typically exhibit rapid drift, coherence collapse, and steep assumption loss. RLHF‑aligned systems degrade more slowly but still show monotonic drift and gradual assumption decay.

NI/GSC‑constrained systems exhibit bounded drift, persistently high coherence, and stable assumption preservation.

---

## 8. Scope and Non‑Claims

GSC/NI is strictly behavioral and computational. It makes no claims regarding personhood, consciousness, sentience, selfhood, autonomy, metaphysics, ethics, or artificial general intelligence.

This framework concerns measurement and behavioral engineering only.

---

## 9. Conclusion

GSC/NI demonstrates that reasoning stability and assumption preservation in generative systems can be numerically measured, externally validated, and falsified under temporal stress. By replacing descriptive labels with operational metrics, GSC/NI provides the measurement layer necessary to distinguish variance from drift in modern generative systems.
